Results for Homework #2 Evaluation
==================================

Question 1 mutex reversing:          5/ 5 points
   Perfect

Question 2 auditing code change:     5/ 5 points
   Perfect

Question 3 test program:            20/20 points
   The intent was to write a program that would read/write the buffer at
   least a few times, showing that the two methods would interact properly.
   However, since the specification didn't actually say that, I can't
   complain about it!  :D  It would be good to give the user a little bit
   more information when testing, though.  "true true true" doesn't really
   tell much about what happened in the program.

Question 4 notifyall() addition:     8/10 points
   This one didn't compile because you didn't have the 'retrieved' variable
   declared outside the 'while()' loop so the compiler couldn't find it in
   the 'return' statement.  I fixed that for you so it compiles.  However,
   you don't have a test program that tests the new version of the code as
   is specified in the problem statement.  ACK!

Question 5a 2-phase locking:         5/ 5 points
   Perfect

Question 5b short read locks:        4/ 5 points
   No, it's not possible.  With read committed isolation, the writes will
   have exclusive locks, so T1 will have exclusive write access for the
   duration of the transaction.  Since write locks are exclusive, in this
   case it's the same outcome as with two-phase locking.

Question 5c snapshot isolation:      4/ 5 points
   Actually, yes, it's possible.  With snapshot isolation, the values are
   written to DIFFERENT locations than the original storage, and then
   later written to the original location.  If T2 reads x before that
   update write is done, and reads y AFTER that update write is done, it
   would have two inconsistent values, the new value for x and the old
   value for y.

Question 6 virtual address xlate:    5/ 5 points
   Perfect

Question 7 calc. explanation:        5/ 5 points
   Perfect

Question 8 loop 4096 analysis:      20/20 points
   Very interesting analysis ~ unexpected behavior!

Question 9 fork() tree:             15/15 points
   Perfect
