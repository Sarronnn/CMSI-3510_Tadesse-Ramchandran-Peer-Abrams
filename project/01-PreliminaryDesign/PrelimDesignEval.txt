Evaluation
----------

Good work on this submission
Very complete explanation in section 1.1
Good rationale in section 1.2 as well; this will be a very useful
   command addition that I'm sure quite a few people would use
Section 1.3 meets the requirements.  Not sure what you mean by
   'reference' the modules, unless that means you will use the
   code from those two modules to make your new one.
Section 1.4 simply lists the name of the command ~ will there be any
   command line options included?

Good work overall!

An "A" job on this first project deliverable ~ professional-quality
   work!
